# Navigating Apps

For clients with multiple apps, users need to navigate between apps. For apps with multiple stories, users need to navigate between apps. Here's how to do that.

## Navigating between apps

For clients with multiple apps, users can navigate between apps from the apps page. In addition, users can navigate directly to a specific app using its app link. 

### From the apps page

Each Juicebox client has its own apps page. For example, the apps page for HealthyCo is https://healthyco.juiceboxdata.com. After logging into the apps page, users will see all of their apps for that client. Access a particular story by clicking it. To get back to the home page from any app, **\[do this\]**.

**\[REPLACE the above image. with home page showing at least 3 apps, with at least one of them having multiple stories.\]**

### From the app link

Each app has a unique link that will take a user directly to the app. For example, the app link for HealthyCo's Unhealthy Americans app is https://healthyco.juiceboxdata.com/a/unhealthy\_americans/.
