# Navigating Apps

For clients with multiple apps, users need to navigate between apps. \(In the future, Juicebox will support multiple stories within an app. For apps with multiple stories, users will need to navigate between stories.\) Here's how to do that.

## Navigating between apps

For clients with multiple apps, users can navigate between apps from the apps page. In addition, users can navigate directly to a specific app using its app link. 

### From the apps page

Each Juicebox client has its own apps page. \(For example, the apps page for HealthyCo is https://healthyco.juiceboxdata.com.\) After logging into the apps page, users will see all of their apps for that client. To access an app, users will click on the story.

To get back to the apps page from any app, click on the app name in the app header.

### From the app link

Each app has a unique link that will take a user directly to the app. For example, the app link for HealthyCo's Unhealthy Americans app is https://healthyco.juiceboxdata.com/a/unhealthy\_americans/.
