# Navigating apps

For clients with multiple apps, users need to navigate between apps. For apps with multiple stories, users need to navigate between apps. Here's how to do that.

## Navigating between apps

For clients with multiple apps, users have various ways to navigate between apps: from the client's home page, from within any app, or directly from a URL.

### From the client home page

Each Juicebox client will have its own home page. \(For example, the home page for client Acme, Inc. might be https://acme.juiceboxdata.com.\) After logging into the client home page, users will see all of their apps for that client. Access a particular story by clicking it. To get back to the home page from any app, **\[do this\]**.

**\[Add new example client on Staging. Why Staging? Because we'll be able to create docs for features before they hit Prod. Is Acme good enough?\]**

**\[REPLACE the above image. with home page showing at least 3 apps, with at least one of them having multiple stories.\]**

### From the app header

From with an app, click the dropdown on the left side of the app header. From the dropdown, select the app you want to go to next.

### From the app link

Each app has a unique link that will take a user directly to the app. For example, if client Acme has an app called Sales Analysis, the link for the app would be https://acme.juiceboxdata.com/a/sales-analysis.
