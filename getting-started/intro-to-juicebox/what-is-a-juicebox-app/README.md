# What is a Juicebox App?

A Juicebox application or app is a web application that you create and share with your audience. It has its own URL. You manage who can see it. It is visible on your custom juiceboxdata.com landing page

So what exactly makes up a Juicebox app? Each app has the following parts that flow in a hierarchy:

* Each **application** \(or **app**\) is the solution you are creating for a target audience. An app is what you’ll give users access to when you are ready to share. It can have multiple...
* **Stories** are the analysis and explanatory workflows that guide your users through the data. Each story is composed of one or more…
* **Sections** are the individual sections of your story. Think of them as paragraphs that carry your users through a section of your story. Groups can have a distinct color background and unique layout of its component. \[More a way to control styling.\]
* **Slices** are the most basic building block of your stories. Each slice can have text and/or a visualization.

## Components of an App

### Data Stories

Each Juicebox Application will have one or more data stories. A data story is like a module within your application. A data story should focus on a topic or view of the data. Each data story guides your users through an analytical exploration of data. Learn more about [data stories](../../../authoring-apps/design-tips/telling-data-stories.md).

### Data Sources

Data sources are the individual data tables that are used to power your data stories.You can have multiple data sources within each data story. Data sources can either be uploaded as CSV files or a connection to a database table. Learn more about [data sources](../../../authoring-apps/data-editor/what-is-a-data-source.md).

### Data Ingredients

Data ingredients are the inputs into your data visualizations and the ‘metadata’ that describe your data fields. You’ll define things like data labels, metric calculations, and number formatting. This is the thankless but most critical part of creating your Juicebox app. Learn more about [data ingredients](../../../authoring-apps/data-editor/create-a-data-source/define-data-ingredients/what-are-data-ingredients.md).
