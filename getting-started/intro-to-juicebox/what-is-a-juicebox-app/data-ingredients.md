# Data Ingredients

Data Ingredients are the data elements that are used to construct your visualizations. There are two main types of ingredients: **measures** and **dimensions**. 

A **measure** is a value calculated for a group of data records. A **dimension** is a value used to create a group of data records. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The word **aggregation** means "a group of data records." So you can also say that a measure is a value calculated for an aggregation, and a dimension is a value used to create an aggregation. 
{% endhint %}

So what does that mean? 

  Common examples include sum, average, count, min, and max. 

Dimensions are 

*  **Measures** \(the measurable values that you typically average or sum up\) and **dimensions** \(the ways that you categorize your data\). Dimensions can have special sub-flavors, such as a place dimension \(for maps\) or a date dimension \(for trends\).
