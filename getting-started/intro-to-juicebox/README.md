# Intro to Juicebox

With Juicebox, you can easily and quickly create interactive **data stories** to share with your users. 

### What is a data story? 

At Juice, we love data stories! A data story is more than just a dashboard. It is targeted to a particular audience and a particular purpose. The story gently guides the user to the actionable insight that the user needs.   
  
With Juicebox, you'll build data stories with our easy-to-use Editor. The Editor will allow you to go from uploading your data to creating your first visualization in just a few minutes!   
  
In the following pages, we'll give you an overview of the components that make up Juicebox, help you learn the lingo, and give you an idea of how all the pieces come together.
