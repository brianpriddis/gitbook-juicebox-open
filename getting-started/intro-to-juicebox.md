# Getting Started with Juicebox

Ready to build Juicebox apps? Great! Once you set up your Juicebox client account and your Juicebox user account, you can start building! 

## Set up your Juicebox client account

The first thing you'll need to do is set up your Juicebox client account. You'll soon be able to set up your client account on your own from our website. In the meantime, please reach out to [amanda@juiceanalytics.com](mailto:amanda@juiceanalytics.com). Amanda will work with you to---

### Select your client subdomain

Your subdomain will be used to generate your apps page. For example, HealthyCo's subdomain is `healthyco`, and its apps page is `https://healthyco.juiceboxdata.com`. The apps page is where your users will go to access their apps. 

### Select your billing plan and provide payment information

There are multiple billing plans available, depending on your needs, including:

* How many author accounts do you need?
* How many viewer accounts do you need?
* Are your users internal \(i.e., from a single email domain\) only?

Amanda will work with you to find the billing plan that best meets your needs. Payment is processed as an annual subscription. 

### Select your initial client owner, admins, and authors

You'll need to select one user to act as client owner and, optionally, users to act as client admins and authors. For each user, we'll need to know their email address and [user role](../managing-apps/user-management-and-roles.md). 

With this information, we'll set up your client account and email access links to the client owner, client admins, and authors.

## Set up your Juicebox user account

Each person designated as a client owner, admin, or author will be sent an access link via email. Upon clicking the link, each person will be asked to set up their Juicebox user account. After setting up their user account, users will be taken to the apps page. From there, authors \(and other users with authoring rights\) will see the **+ New App** button. Clicking that button will begin the app authoring process.
