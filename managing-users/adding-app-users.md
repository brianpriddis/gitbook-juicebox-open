# Adding App Users

Inviting new users to an app is done by [sharing the app access link](../authoring-apps/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md#access-links). Anyone who clicks on the access link and [signs in](../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) becomes a new user with the [Viewer user role](user-management-and-roles.md#viewer).
