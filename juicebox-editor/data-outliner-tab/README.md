# Data Outliner Tab

Every data story starts with data. Your Onboarding Manager will work with you to obtain and load your data so that it is available when you begin working on your app. At this time, the data will need to be provided as a single CSV with a file size not to exceed 10 MB. \(Additional data options are coming soon!\)

You will use the Data Outliner to define the data ingredients for use in creating visualizations. To access the Data Outliner, select the third tab on the left hand side of the editing panel.
