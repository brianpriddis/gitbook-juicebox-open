# User Management & Roles

Before you can view an app, you must set up a Juicebox user account. Each person invited to an app will set up a Juicebox user account. What a user can do once logged in depends on their user role.  There are four user roles: viewer, author, client admin, and client owner. 

## Viewers

Viewers can view the apps they've been given access to. They cannot see apps they have not been given access to and they cannot create new apps or make changes to existing apps. 

## Authors

Authors can create new apps and can make changes to apps for which they are an author. 

## Client Admins

## Client Owners
