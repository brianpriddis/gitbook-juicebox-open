# User Management & Roles

Before you can view an app, you must set up a Juicebox user account. Each person invited to an app will set up a Juicebox user account. What a user can do once logged in depends on their user role.  There are four user roles: viewer, author, client admin, and client owner. 

## User Roles

### Viewers

Viewers can view the apps they've been given access to. They cannot see apps they have not been given access to and they cannot create new apps or make changes to existing apps. 

### Authors

Authors can create new apps and make changes to apps they've created or apps for which they've been made an author.  Authors can also invite new viewers to their apps by sending access links. 

### Client Admins

Client admins can create new apps and make changes to any app. Admins can invite new viewers to apps and manage user roles for any app. Admins can also generate and re-generate access links and set email domain control for apps. 

### Client Owners

Client owners can do everything client admins can do plus adjust the billing plan and payment information. **\[There is only one client owner for a Juicebox client.\]**

## User Management \(coming soon!\)

Client owners and admins will have access to the user management view. From this view, user roles can be adjusted and app access links can be generated and re-generated. In this way, owners and admins can control the number of users and authors.
