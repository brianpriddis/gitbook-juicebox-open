# Sharing Apps

Once you've built your app, it's time to share it! There are two ways to share apps: access links and email domain control.

## Sharing by access links

To share using access links, you first generate an access link and then share the link with anybody you want to see the app. Access links give access to anyone clicking the link, but to a certain maximum. If the maximum is reach, you can regenerate the access link.

If an existing Juicebox user clicks the link, the app will be added to the user's available apps. If a person clicks the link who is not already a Juicebox user, the person will be invited to set up a user account first and, after account setup, be given access to the app.

## Sharing by email domain control

Sharing by email domain control gives everyone with an email address having that domain access to the app. For example, if you set up email domain control for acme.com, everyone with an acme.com email address will have access to the app after setting up their Juicebox user account.
