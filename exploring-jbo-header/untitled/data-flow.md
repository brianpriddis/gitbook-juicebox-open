# Data Flow

There are two standard ways that we ensure that the data stories give users a connected workflow as they explore your data  


1. Visualizations on cards automatically act as filters for the cards that are positioned after them in the story flow. Therefore, a selection of a bar or bubble will necessarily filter the data further down the page.
2. Certain visualizations \(measure chooser, dimension chooser\) can capture selections to be used by other visualizations as inputs. For example, you can allow for the selection of two metrics, ‘revenue’ and ‘cost’. You can then use the chosen selection, perhaps ‘revenue’ to show a breakout of revenue by product.
