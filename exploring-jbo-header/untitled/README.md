# Quick Overview

Juicebox Open \(JBO\) is the self-service version of our **Juicebox** platform. With JBO, you can easily and quickly create interactive **data stories** to share with your users.

**Juicebox** has additional features, capabilities, and flexibility that are not available through Juicebox Open. Those components are accessible through our professional services, which we call **Juicebox Pro**. However, from a technology standpoint, it is all the same platform.

### What is a data story? 

At Juice, we love data stories! A data story is more than just a dashboard. It is targeted to a particular audience and a particular purpose. The story gently guides the user to the actionable insight that the user needs.   
  
With JBO, you'll build data stories with our easy to use editor. The JBO Editor will allow you to go from uploading your data to creating your first visualization in just a few minutes!   
  
In the following pages, we'll give you an overview of the components that make up JBO, help you learn the lingo, and give you an idea of how all the pieces come together.
