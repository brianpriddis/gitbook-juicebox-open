# Quick Overview

Juicebox Open \(JBO\) is the self-service version of our Juicebox platform. As a platform for building interactive data storytelling applications, Juicebox has features, capabilities, and flexibility that are not available through Juicebox Open but accessible through our professional services, which we call Juicebox Pro. From a technology standpoint, it is all the same platform.
