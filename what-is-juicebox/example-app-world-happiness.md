# An example app

Throughout this documentation, we will consider the needs of HealthyCo \(a fake client\). HealthyCo is a healthcare company that promotes health. 

HealthyCo needs an app that will pinpoint where in the US customers most need its health-promoting products. Using Juicebox, HealthyCo built the [Unhealthy Americans](https://healthyco.juiceboxdata.com/unhealthy-americans) app. This app was built using [this data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3buqwkK6JGWL7LxX-EcNDycCdxnYxYxLD9d_d2CDmI/edit?usp=sharing) from the [CDC](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral/hn4x-zwk7).

We'll use the Unhealthy Americans app to demonstrate how to build an app using the Juicebox platform and how to use an app once it's built.
