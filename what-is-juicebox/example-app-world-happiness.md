Throughout this documentation, we will use an example app, [the World Happiness app](www.example.com), to demonstrate how to build an app using the Juicebox platform and how to use a Juicebox app once it's built. 

**\[Can this data demonstrate all visualizations, including trend? If not, should we find a different example? Census data?\]**
