# What is Juicebox?

**Juicebox** is a platform that lets you easily create and share beautiful, interactive data visualization apps. No code required!

A Juicebox **app** is the solution you create with Juicebox. [Here's an example of a Juicebox app](example-app-world-happiness.md). Each app has its own URL and you manage who can view it or make changes to it.

## Parts of a Juicebox app

So what makes up a Juicebox app? Each app has the following parts that flow in a hierarchy:

* A [**story**](../authoring-apps/story-designer/what-is-a-story.md) \(or data story\) is a set of visualizations on the page, similar to a data dashboard. Each story is tightly focused on a particular audience and a particular purpose. The story gently guides the user to the actionable insight the user needs. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. \(Support for multiple stories per app is coming soon.\)
* Each [**section**](../authoring-apps/story-designer/story-sections.md) is composed of one or more slices. Sections allow you to control layouts and background colors within the story.
* \*\*\*\*[**Slices**](../authoring-apps/story-designer/slices/) are the basic building block of your story. Each slice can have text and/or charts.

## Juicebox magic

We've built a lot of magic into the Juicebox platform, including:

* **No code required**. You can build a Juicebox app entirely from your browser using the [app editor](../authoring-apps/creating-and-editing/app-editor-a-quick-tour.md). If you know how to create a formula in a spreadsheet, you are ready to start building apps. 
* **Interactivity is automatic**. Selections made in slices above _automatically_ flow down to the slices below, allowing users to drill down and drive the story where they want to go. We call this [data flow](../viewing-apps/data-flow.md).
* **Sharing is the point**. Juicebox apps are meant to be [shared](../authoring-apps/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md)--easily, widely, and without budget stress.
