# What is Juicebox?

**Juicebox** is a platform that lets you easily create and share beautiful, interactive data visualization apps. No code required!

A Juicebox **app** is the solution you create with Juicebox. [Here's an example of a Juicebox app](www.example.com). Each app has its own URL and you manage who can view it or make changes to it.

## Parts of a Juicebox App

So what makes up a Juicebox app? Each app has the following parts that flow in a hierarchy:

* A **story** \(or data story\) is a set of visualizations on the page, similar to a data dashboard. Each story is tightly focused on a particular audience and a particular purpose. A story gently guides the user to the actionable insight that the user needs. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. 
* Each **section** is composed of one or more slices. Sections allow you to control layouts and background colors within the story.
* **Slices** are the basic building block of your story. Each slice can have text and/or visualizations. Selections made in slices above _automatically_ flow down to the slices below. We call this the [**data flow**](data-flow.md).
