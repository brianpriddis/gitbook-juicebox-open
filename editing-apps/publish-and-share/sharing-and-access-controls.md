# Sharing and access controls

After you publish your app, it's time to invite others to view it! To do this, you simply share an access link. 

## Access links

To share your app, 

* navigate to the Publish & Share section of the app editor
* copy the the access link
* share the link with anyone you want to view your app

The access link can be sent via email, text, social media, or any other means. The link can be used by multiple people and will remain live until you [regenerate the link](sharing-and-access-controls.md#regenerate-link).

When a person clicks on the link, they will be asked to [sign in](../../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) to see the app. 

## Access controls

### Regenerate link

To prevent new users from accessing the app, simply regenerate the link. Any previous links will no longer allow new users to sign up. Users that have signed up using previous links will continue to have access to the app.

### User email domain \(future release\)

In a future release, access links will be able to limit access to only users with specific email domains.
