# Useful resources

## Markdown

Slice text uses Markdown. This [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a great guide.

## Icons

Ingredients use Font Awesome icons. 

## Colors and images

Here are some tools we like for finding the right colors and images for your app:

* [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka?hl=en): a Google Chrome extension that lets you find the hex code for any color on most websites
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/): a source for freely-usable images, with photographer attribution.
