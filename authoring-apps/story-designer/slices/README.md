# Slices

Slices are the basic building blocks of your story. Slices are added to [sections](../sections.md), and each slice can have text and/or a [chart](../charts/). 

## Adding and deleting slices

To add a slice to an empty section, select the **+ Add Slice** button.

To add a slice to a section that has one or more slices, click the **+** where you want the new slice to appear.

Rather than adding a brand new slice, it may be easier to duplicate and modify an existing slice. To duplicate a slice, select the menu icon \(![](../../../.gitbook/assets/ellipsis-h-solid.svg)\) in the slice you want to duplicate and select **Duplicate** from the dropdown. The new duplicate slice will appear directly below the original slice.

To delete a slice, select the menu icon \(![](../../../.gitbook/assets/ellipsis-h-solid.svg)\) in the slice you want to duplicate and select **Delete** from the dropdown.

## Slice content

Slices can contain text, a chart, or both a chart and text.

### Adding text

To add text to a slice, simply type in the text area. The text area supports most of the basic [Markdown](../../design-tips/useful-resources.md#markdown) syntax, including headings, links, and images.

If the section or slice has a dark background color, you can make the first line of text in the slice  `--invert` to change the text color to white.

### Adding a chart

To add a chart to a slice, select the **+Chart** button and select the desired [chart](../charts/) from the list.

## Reordering slices

To reorder slices, hover over the slice and put the cursor over the handle icon \( ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/grip-vertical-solid.svg) \) until the cursor becomes a hand. Then drag the slice and drop it where you want it to display.

## Slice layouts

There are four layout options for slices that control how slice text will appear in relation to the chart. To adjust the layout, hover over the slice, click the layout icon, and select the desired layout option.

| Icon | Layout option | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-down-solid.svg)  | Top to bottom | The slice text will display above the chart. This is the default layout. |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-up-solid.svg)  | Bottom to top | The slice text will display below the chart. |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-right-solid%20%281%29.svg)  | Left to right | The slice text will display to the left of the chart. |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-left-solid.svg)  | Right to left | The slice text will display to the right of the chart. |

{% hint style="info" %}
For text-only slices, each layout will display the same. 
{% endhint %}

## Slice backgrounds

By default, slices have a transparent background. To adjust the background color, hover over the slice, click the paint drop icon, and select the desired color from the color picker. If you have a specific color in mind, you can enter the hex code for that color.
