# Working with multiple data sources

While each slice is limited to ingredients from a single data source, slices within a story do not have to use the same data source. For example, suppose you have two data sources \(A and  B\) and two slices \(1, 2\). The following combinations are all options:

| Slice | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Slice 1 | Data Source A | Data Source A | Data Source B | Data Source B |
| Slice 2 | Data Source A | Data Source B | Data Source A | Data Source B |

Notice that options 2 and 3 combine more than one data source. While you can do this, it is important to understand how slices filter each other to avoid unexpected results.
