# Story Settings

At the very top of the Story Outliner, you’ll see the Story Settings. Here’s where you can configure your header color. \(Additional configuration options are coming soon! Soon you’ll be able to adjust your story’s title, description, font, and other colors used in the app.\)

Note: Adjusting the story title and description at this point won’t do anything useful and might cause problems. For now, just leave those as is.
