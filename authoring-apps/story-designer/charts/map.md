# Map

The map chart displays a place dimension as a bubble on a map. Optionally, the bubble can be sized and colored by measures. Adding a slice with a map chart \(i.e., a map slice\) is a good choice when users want to see geographic information.  

## Adding a map slice

To add a map slice:

* select **Map** from the chart list
* select the place dimension you want to display as a bubble on the map
* \(optional\) select a measure to use for the bubble size
* \(optional\) select a measure to use for the bubble color
* select a map style
* \(optional\) add a title

{% hint style="info" %}
The map slice requires that one of your dimensions be a [place dimension](../../data-sources/#dimensions).  A place dimension has associated latitude and longitude fields.
{% endhint %}

## Using a map slice

Selections made in the map slice will filter downstream slices.
