# Table

The table chart displays selected ingredients as columns in a table. Adding a slice with a table chart \(i.e., a table slice\) is a good choice when users want to review the details or download data for further ad hoc analysis. 

## Adding a table slice

To add a table slice:

* select **Table** from the chart list
* select the ingredients you want displayed in the table in the order you want them displayed
* choose whether you want users to be able to download the data
* \(optional\) add a title

## Using a table slice

Users can search, sort, and download the data in the table chart. To search, click the filter pill and search for any value in the table. To sort the data by the values in a particular column, click on the column name. If data download is enabled, click on the Data button to download the data as an Excel spreadsheet.
