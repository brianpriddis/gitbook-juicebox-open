# Bar

The bar chart displays a dimension ranked by a measure. Adding a slice with a bar chart \(i.e., a bar slice\) is a good choice when users want to compare measures between categories \(i.e., dimension values\).

## Adding a bar slice

To add a bar slice:

* select **Bar** from the chart list
* select the dimension with your categories you want to compare
* choose the measure you want to use to make the comparison
* \(optional\) add a title

## Using a bar slice

Users can scroll if necessary to see all categories. Users can select one or more categories \(i.e., dimension values\) to filter downstream slices.
