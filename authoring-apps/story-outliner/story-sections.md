# Sections

### Sections <a id="docs-internal-guid-3f04fa94-7fff-e04d-86d4-f27746d31af9"></a>

Sections are groups of cards. You can define layouts and background colors for the section, which will affect all cards in the section. 

#### Add a section

To add a section, scroll to the bottom of the editing panel. There you will see the Add Section button.

When you click Add Section, a new section will be added at the end of your story. The section will initially be empty, waiting for you to add a card.

#### Delete a section

To delete a section, hover over the section until you see the Delete icon \(trash can\) and click the trash can.

#### Collapse and reorder sections

To move a section up or down, hover over the Reorder icon until you see a hand. Then drag the section and drop it where you want it.

Because sections or groups can get quite long, reordering will be easier if you collapse your sections first. To collapse a group, simply click on the gray area at the top of the group. To expand a collapsed group, click on the gray area again.
