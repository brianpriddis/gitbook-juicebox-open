# Creating and Editing

To create new apps or edit existing apps, a user must be an author for the app, or a client admin or client owner.  

## Add a new app

To add a new app,  select **+ New App**  from the apps page. You can also select **+ New App** from the dropdown in the app header.  

Selecting **+ New App** will start the app creation wizard, which will walk you through creating your app.

Once your app is created, you will use the [app editor](app-editor-a-quick-tour.md) to add your data source and design your story.  

## Edit an app

## Delete an app

This is done through the [App Settings](../app-settings.md).
