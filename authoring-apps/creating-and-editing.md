# Creating and Editing

If you're logged in as an author \(or a user with authoring rights\), you're ready to create and edit apps.

## Add a new app

To add a new app,  select **+ New App** from the apps page. Selecting **+ New App** will start the app creation wizard, which walks you through creating your app. Here's a video showing how the Unhealthy Americans app was created:

Once your app is created, you will be taken automatically to the app editor to add your data source and design your story.  **\[TODO: Video shows the user being taken to the apps page. Replace video.\]**

## Edit an app

Changes can be made to a draft version of the app using an in-browser interface called the **app editor**. Only authors for the app, client admins, and client owners can access the app editor. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Changes made in the app editor are immediately reflected in the draft app. Changes made in the app editor are not seen by viewers until the changes are published. 
{% endhint %}

### Accessing the app editor

To access the app editor for an existing app, select **Edit** on the app \(or the pencil icon on the story\) from the apps page, or select **Edit App** from the profile menu in the app header of a published app.

### Overview of the app editor

Changes to an app are made to a draft version of the app. If you see the app editor, you know you are in the draft version. The app editor is a panel on the left side of the draft app.

There are four app editor sections: [App Settings](app-settings.md), [Data Sources](data-sources/), [Story Designer](story-designer/), and [Publish & Share](publish-and-share/). These sections are accessed from the buttons at the top of the app editor. These sections are covered on the following pages:

{% page-ref page="app-settings.md" %}

{% page-ref page="data-sources/" %}

{% page-ref page="story-designer/" %}

{% page-ref page="publish-and-share/" %}

## Delete an app

[Deleting an app](app-settings.md#deleting-an-app) is done from App Settings.
