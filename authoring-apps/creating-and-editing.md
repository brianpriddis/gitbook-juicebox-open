# Creating and Editing Apps

If you're logged in as [an author \(or a user with authoring rights\)](../managing-apps/user-management-and-roles.md#user-roles), you're able to create and edit apps.

## Add a new app

To add a new app, select **+ New App** from the apps page. Selecting **+ New App** will start the app creation wizard, which walks you through creating your app. Here's a video showing how the Unhealthy Americans app was created:

Once your app is created, you will see the app on the apps page. You're now ready to edit the app to [add your data source](data-sources/) and [design your story](story-designer/).  ****

## Edit an app

You can make changes to a draft version of the app using an in-browser interface called the **app editor**. Only [users with authoring rights](../managing-apps/user-management-and-roles.md#user-roles) can access the app editor. 

{% hint style="info" %}
While changes made in the app editor are immediately reflected in the draft app, viewers cannot see the changes until they are published.
{% endhint %}

### Accessing the app editor

To access the app editor, select **Edit** on the app \(or the pencil icon on the story\) from the apps page, or select **Edit this app** from the profile menu in a published app's header.

### Overview of the app editor

Changes to an app are made to a draft version of the app. If you see the app editor, you know you are in the draft version. The app editor is a panel on the left side of the draft app. Changes made \(and saved\) in the app editor are immediately reflected and saved in the draft app.

There are four app editor sections: [App Settings](app-settings.md), [Data Sources](data-sources/), [Story Designer](story-designer/), and [Publish & Share](publish-and-share/). These sections are accessed from the buttons at the top of the app editor and are described on the following pages:

{% page-ref page="app-settings.md" %}

{% page-ref page="data-sources/" %}

{% page-ref page="story-designer/" %}

{% page-ref page="publish-and-share/" %}

## Delete an app

[Deleting an app](https://juicebox.gitbook.io/juicebox/authoring-apps/app-settings#deleting-an-app) is done from App Settings.
