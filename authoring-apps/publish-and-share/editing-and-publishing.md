# Editing & Publishing

## Publishing an app

Before publishing your app, only app Authors can see the changes you've made. When you're ready to share your work with Viewers, it's time to publish. Simply go to **Publish & Share** in the Editing Panel and click **Publish**.

After publishing your app for the first time, Publish & Share will look like this. You can see the published version by clicking **View Published App** \(this will open the published app in a new browser tab\) or copy the access link to share the app.

## Making changes to an app

Any changes you make to an app are automatically saved to a draft version of the app that only Authors can see. Viewers will not see your changes until you publish them. You publish, refine your app, republish, refine some more, republish, and so on. In this way, you can continually improve and experiment with your app without disturbing Viewers. 

Because all changes are saved to the draft version until they are published, you do not have to keep track of whether you are working in the draft version. But here are indicators that you are in the draft version:

* You will see "There are unpublished changes..." in **Publish & Share**
* You will see "draft" in the app link
* You will see an Unpublished pill in the app header

## Discard changes to an app

If at some point you want to discard all the changes in the draft version, you can do this by **\[how?\]**.
