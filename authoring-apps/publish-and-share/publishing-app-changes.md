# Publishing app changes

## Publishing an app

Before publishing your app, only authors can see the changes you've made. When you're ready to share your work with viewers, it's time to publish. 

### Publishing for the first time

To publish for the first time, go to the Publish & Share section in the app editor and click **Publish**.

### Republishing

Changes made after the first publishing will not be seen by viewers until they are republished. When you make changes to the app, the Publish & Share section's name will change to **Republish & Share**. To republish, go to the Republish & Share section and click **Republish changes**.

## Making changes to an app

Any changes you make to an app are automatically saved to a draft version of the app that only authors can see. Viewers will not see your changes until you publish them. You publish, refine your app, republish, refine some more, republish, and so on. In this way, you can continually improve and experiment with your app without disturbing viewers. 

Because all changes are saved to the draft version until they are published, you do not have to keep track of whether you are working in the draft version. But here are indicators that you are in the draft version:

* You will see "draft" in the app link
* Prior to first publishing:
  * You will see "There are unpublished changes..." in Publish & Share
  * You will see an "Unpublished" pill in the app header
* After first publishing:
  * The Publish & Share section's name will change to Republish & Share, highlighted yellow, if there are any unpublished changes
  * You will see an "Unpublished changes" pill in the app header

## Discard changes to an app

If at some point you may want to discard all the unpublished changes in the draft version and go back to the published version. To do this, go to the Republish & Share section and select **Discard changes**. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Discarding changes will discard _**all changes**_ made since the last publishing _i**ncluding changes to data sources**_. 
{% endhint %}
