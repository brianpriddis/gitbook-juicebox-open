# Sharing & Access Controls

Once you've built your app, it's time to share it! Sharing is done through access links. By default, anyone who clicks the an access link can get access to view the app. Optionally, you can set email domain control, which limits access to only those people with email addresses having a specific email domain.

## Access links

To share using access links, you first generate an access link and then share the link with anybody you want to see the app. Access links give access to anyone clicking the link, up to a certain maximum number of users. Once the maximum is reached, no additional users will get access until you regenerate the access link.

If an existing Juicebox user clicks the link, the app will be added to the user's available apps. If a person clicks the link who is not already a Juicebox user, the person will be invited to set up a user account first and, after account setup, be given access to the app.

## Email domain control

**\[THIS IS NOT RIGHT\]** Sharing by email domain control gives everyone with an email address having that domain access to the app. For example, if you set up email domain control for acme.com, everyone with an @acme.com email address will have access to the app after setting up their Juicebox user account.
