# Add a data source

There are two steps to adding a data source: 

1. upload or connect to your data, and 
2. define your data ingredients.

## Upload or connect to your data

You can upload a CSV or connect to database table or view. \(Coming soon, you can connect to a Google Sheet.\)

### Upload a CSV

To upload a CSV, click **Connect & Upload Data** and select the CSV file. Then wait about 15-30 seconds. Once the CSV has loaded, a modal will pop up that confirms the [ingredients that were inferred from your data](define-data-ingredients/inferred-ingredients.md).

When using CSVs, it is important that your data is nice and clean. Common problem areas include missing data, text values in numeric columns, and leading or trailing spaces. Here are some tips for [preparing your data](../data-outliner-tab/preparing-your-data.md).
