## Update ingredient definitions

To make a change to an ingredient definition, click on the ingredient pill in either the Data Sources or Story Designer sections of the app editor. This will open up the ingredient editor. Clicking the pill for a [basic ingredient](defining-ingredients/#basic-ingredients) will open the basic ingredient editor. Clicking the pill for an [advanced ingredient](defining-ingredients/#advanced-ingredients) will open the advanced ingredient editor.  If you need to make a change to a basic ingredient that cannot be done using the basic ingredient editor, you will need to [add an advanced ingredient](defining-ingredients/#adding-an-advanced-ingredient).
