# Advanced ingredients

In cases where you need to do something more than the ingredient editor allows, you can use advanced ingredients. 

## Adding an advanced ingredient

To create an advanced ingredient, click on the ingredient pill for a field you will use in your definition. From there, click the menu icon \(![](../../../.gitbook/assets/ellipsis-h-solid.svg)\), and select **Duplicate as Advanced**.

This will make a copy of the ingredient and open the advanced ingredient text editor. Modify the ingredient definition in the text editor as needed.

## What you can do with advanced ingredients

Advanced ingredients allow you to define the [ingredient components](../add-a-data-source.md#ingredient-components) in a text editor. Advanced ingredients allow you to use--

* Dimensions that [display a lookup value](lookup-dimensions.md) rather than the field value
* Dimensions that [group values into "buckets"](bucketed-dimensions.md) based on conditions 
* Measures and dimensions that [use field math](complex-formulas-incomplete.md#field-math)
* Measures that [use multiple aggregation functions](complex-formulas-incomplete.md#multiple-aggregate-functions)
* Measures and dimensions that [include conditional logic](complex-formulas-incomplete.md#conditional-logic)
* Measures or numeric dimensions formatted to [use any d3 number format](advanced-formats-incomplete.md#advanced-number-formats)
* Date dimensions formatted to [use any d3 date format](advanced-formats-incomplete.md#advanced-date-formats)
