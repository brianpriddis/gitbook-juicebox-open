# Data Ingredients

Data Ingredients are the data elements that are used to construct your visualizations. Ingredients come in two general flavors: metrics \(the measurable values that you typically average or sum up\) and dimensions \(the ways that you categorize your data\). Dimensions can have special sub-flavors, such as a place dimension \(for maps\) or a time/date dimension \(for trends\).  


In Juicebox, it is important to define which data fields are dimensions or metrics so we can properly used them when creating visualizations. When we get into the details of defining our ingredients, we will want to choose a number format and calculation for our metrics. We will also be able to define how each ingredient is labeled or displayed when it shows up in your data stories. You can even mix multiple data fields to create new calculated ingredients.
