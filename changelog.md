### 🐛Bug Fixes & Other improvements

* **A better new-app template** - Now, when you make a fresh new app, you'll get a nice template with a header, intro, and sections to fill in to make your data story even more envied by your coworkers.
* **Automagically add your data**🎩- When you add a Data Source to an app, press the "[Add Automagically](authoring-apps/data-sources/adding-ingredients/#adding-ingredients-automagically)" button to tell Juicebox which data columns you're most interested in.
* **Story designer slice card improvements** - Added emphasis to the "Save" button, added nice hovering touches, and cleaned some dusty corners.
* **No more "null island" ☠️🏝** - The map chart no longer displays Place dimension values where the latitude or longitude are missing \(null\) or are exactly 0,0 \(the location of what we affectionately call null island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We're guessing that's not the location you really wanted 💀\).
* **Table slice column headers now resize** - The table chart no longer cuts off multi-line column headers. Instead, the column header will resize to fit. Nobody likes being squeezed into something that's too small.
* Various performance and bug fixes.
